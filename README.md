# Unifiedkappa-phonopy
Scripts for computing diagonal and off-diagonal contributions to lattice thermal conductivity using ShengBTE outputs.
# How to use the scripts
* Install the rivsed phonopy using "pip install -e ." (development mode)
* Go to unifiedkappa/example and run "python ../script_kappa_deg.py"
* Folder unifiedkappa/example contains the inputs and outputs typically found in ShengBTE
