# Unifiedkappa-phonopy
Scripts for computing the diagonal and off-diagonal contributions to lattice thermal conductivity, based on the inputs and outputs from ShengBTE. The revised-phonopy can produce off-diagonal group velocities tensors with degeneracy properly treated.
# How to use the scripts
* Install the rivsed phonopy (revised-phonopy.zip) using "pip install -e ." (development mode)
* Go to folder "unifiedkappa/example" and run "python ../script_kappa_deg.py"
* Folder "unifiedkappa/example" contains the inputs and outputs typically found in ShengBTE calculations
